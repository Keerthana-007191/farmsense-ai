🌱 FarmSense: Hybrid AI Monitoring for Smart Crop Protection
🚜 Overview
FarmSense is an AI-powered agriculture solution designed to help farmers protect crops, reduce losses, and improve yield. The platform combines acoustic sensing and computer vision to detect pest activity and crop diseases early, providing real-time alerts and treatment recommendations.
Our mission is to empower farmers with smart technology that makes agriculture more efficient, sustainable, and data-driven.
❗ Problem Statement
Farmers face major challenges that directly impact crop productivity:
Late detection of pests leads to severe crop damage.
Crop diseases often spread before visible symptoms appear.
Manual monitoring is time-consuming and unreliable.
Lack of real-time insights prevents quick decision-making.
Excessive pesticide use harms soil and increases costs.
There is a strong need for an intelligent system that can continuously monitor fields and warn farmers before the damage becomes irreversible.
💡 Proposed Solution
FarmSense uses a hybrid AI approach to monitor crop health:
✅ Acoustic Sensors detect pest sounds in real time.
✅ Computer Vision analyzes crop images to identify diseases.
✅ AI Models generate alerts and suggest treatments.
✅ Smart Dashboard allows farmers to monitor field conditions easily.
This proactive system helps farmers act early instead of reacting late.
